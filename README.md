# Java-Mini-Coding-Challenge
These are the mini coding challenge files that I practise after my final projects and final year's exams. Many more files will be coming to this folder later.
------------------- File List And Description ----------------
1. AlphabetArray.java
Write a function that returns an array each element is a letter of the alphabet, from "A" to "Z" (exactly once, in order and upper case).
Your code cannot contain the character \' (quote), \" (double quote) or \` (back quote) both regular and recursive version.

2. AppTest.java
A calculator app in Java Swing which can perform most of the calculator functions as the real world calculator.

3. ArrayOfMultiples.java
takes two arguments, the first number and the number of elements
start from the first number and create multiples until reach the length of array
e.g. arrayOfMultiples(15,4) => [15, 30, 45, 60]

4. BBQueue.java
To test the functions of Queue

5. CountIntegerDigits.java
To count number of digits
e.g. countDigits(-1234) => 4

6. DuplicateChar.java
To find duplicate chars in a string, and display the most occurence char and frequency of this char
e.g.countDuplicateChar("The maximum frequency of duplicate character is the maximum value") => Most duplicate char is e = 7

7. Fibonacci.java
Show 40 Fibonacci terms (0 to 39) in three different methods. Regular looping array method (show all from 0 to 39th term), recursive method (39th term only) and golden ratio constant method (39th term only).

8. GuessANumAI.java
Generate a random number between 0 and 1,000,000 and print the number out. And let the algorithm to guess the number and just tell the algorithm whether the guess is too low or too high and count the number of guessses until it has the correct guess. (Note: I have tested many times and the algorithm can guess the number in around 25 times or lower.)

9. IntReverseAndNot.java
It takes an integer value and returns a string of the backward integer value followed by the original integer value.

10. IntegerToRoman.java
Convert an integer to a Roman numeral string. Assume only positive integer (1 to 3,999) should be entered.
